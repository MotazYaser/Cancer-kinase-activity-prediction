# Cancer-kinase-activity-prediction
Multi-Task Graph Neural Network for predicting kinase inhibitor activity using molecular graph representations. Leverages advanced deep learning techniques to classify compound interactions across multiple kinase targets. Utilizes ChEMBL data, ensemble learning, and GNNs to improve drug discovery computational screening processes.
